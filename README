Duvet is going to be a per-test coverage plugin for nose and tools for getting
useful data out of the reports.


Currently no Python 3 support because of GitPython.


How it works
============

Duvet records full coverage reports for every test function. Along with this it
keeps the commit id of the code that was run.

It then uses the diff between the current working copy and the latest known coverage
report to identify which tests were effected by the changes so it can run those first.
